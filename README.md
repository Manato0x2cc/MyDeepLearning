## Introduction
Deep Learning is one of the ways to make Neural Network. Deep Learning is of wide application so many companies and data scientists or others study about it to make world better, useful and powerful. Deep Learning hasn't been long since, we can have big dream if we are mastering.

## Human Training
This is the check list url of "Human Training" (Not Machine) that we should see.

## Image Recognition
### MNIST
- MNIST can be called "getting started" of deep learning. Even just try the model of default, you can make the model that can understand over 92 recognition. This repositry's model is keras's tutorial model but it can understand over 99 recognition if you take 20 epochs. MNIST is a small dataset that you easily train the model WITHOUT GPU. Try it!
- MnistApp.py is a GUI application that you can write numbers and try your model.
