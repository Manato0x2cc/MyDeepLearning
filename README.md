## Introduction
This repository is separeted to two parts.

### ImageRecognition 
is a project that makes computers understand what is in a given picture as an input. MNIST is an app that predicts what character is input by a user. This can predict numbers, alphabet and Japanese hiragana. Shingeki is a project that detects what character is in a scene of Attack of Titan. Actually it uses opencv to detect where a face is, it only detects who the given face is. These are from tutorials of keras.

### gomoku
is a project that makes computers play game Gomoku Narabe, which is a traditional game in Japan. That rule is simple, players put five stones in a line to win. An agent learns how to win by using reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm for computer to learn the best action by getting rewards. in this project, reward is win: 1, lose: -1,input is a arrays of stones.
